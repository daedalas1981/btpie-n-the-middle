# BTPIE-N-THE-MIDDLE

**Modern Bluetooth Proxy-In-The-Middle (MITM) Tool for Raspberry Pi**

Clean Python 3.x MITM relay with full two-way logging, device scanning, pairing management, modular design, interactive guided setup, and improved robustness for Raspberry Pi OS.

## üî• Features

- Written from scratch in Python 3.x
- Compatible with latest Raspberry Pi 64-bit OS (Full and Lite)
- Classic Bluetooth (RFCOMM) relay between devices
- Full bidirectional hex-dump logging
- Device scanning, pairing list, and trust management
- Prevents duplicate Master/Slave device assignment
- Custom RFCOMM port option
- Verbose console output option
- Bluetooth auto-enablement failsafe
- Interactive step-by-step guided setup script
- Modular, extensible, MIT License

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Bookworm or newer)
- Python 3.9+ recommended
- `pybluez` library (install via apt)

Install system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-pybluez bluetooth pi-bluetooth
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

# Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices
```bash
python3 -m scripts.btpie --scan
```
# List paired/trusted devices
```bash
python3 -m scripts.btpie --paired
```
# Trust a Bluetooth device by MAC address
```bash
python3 -m scripts.btpie --trust 00:04:3E:8F:AF:1F
```
# Untrust/remove trust for a device
```bash
python3 -m scripts.btpie --untrust 00:04:3E:8F:AF:1F
```
# Run the MITM relay with full logging
```bash
python3 -m scripts.btpie --mitm --master 00:04:3E:8F:AF:1F --slave 00:02:1E:8F:AF:3F --log logs/session.log --port 1 --verbose
```
# Run interactive step-by-step setup
```bash
python3 -m scripts.interactive_btpie
```
# Check Bluetooth status before scanning
```bash
bluetoothctl show
```

| Flag         | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `--scan`     | Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices (discovery mode)    |
| `--paired`   | List currently paired/trusted devices                 |
| `--trust`    | Trust a device by MAC address using `bluetoothctl`    |
| `--untrust`  | Remove trust for a device by MAC address              |
| `--mitm`     | Run the MITM relay functionality                      |
| `--master`   | MAC address of the connecting client (e.g., MotoScan) |
| `--slave`    | MAC address of the target device (e.g., OBD Adapter)  |
| `--log`      | Log file path (default: `logs/session.log`)           |
| `--port`     | RFCOMM port to use (default: 1)                       |
| `--verbose`  | Enable verbose console output of hex data             |
| `--version`  | Show BTPIE version                                    |

## üõ† How It Works

* Ensures Bluetooth is powered on automatically
* Waits for master device (e.g., MotoScan) to connect
* Establishes outbound connection to slave device (e.g., OBD Adapter)
* Relays traffic in both directions, with timestamped hex-dump logging
* Prevents identical Master and Slave assignments with user confirmation prompt
* Supports reconnecting and only accepts trusted master devices
* Can scan and manage Bluetooth trust relationships via `bluetoothctl`
* Optional custom port and verbose modes for advanced use
* Step-by-step guided setup available for easier configuration

## üîó Related Projects

This project was inspired by the concept of Bluetooth Proxy-in-the-Middle tools like [btproxy by conorpp](https://github.com/conorpp/btproxy), but was built entirely from scratch in Python 3 with modern design, improved stability, and added features.
